VOX POP
The game where you find out what your friends really think!
(4-12 players, 30 minutes+)

HOW TO PLAY
Vox Pop is played with a series of cardboard disks, that have selectable answers on them. The players sit in a circle, taking turns to ask a question of the group. Everyone in the group then dials in their answer on the disk they have, and then place them face down in the center of the group. Once all disks are in the middle, the player asking the question shuffles the disks (To preserve anonymity) before turning them over ans reading out and grouping the results. Everyone takes a disk and the next round, with the next person asking the questions begins.
You'd be surprised what your friends will admit to. I was :-)

ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS
There are three different disks. One with words / choices and two without. 
Cut the two disks without words out of thick card. I used a laser cutter to cut 2mm heavy black cardstock. 
Print the disks with words out on a printer and cut out by hand. 
The disk with words is then stuck with glue to the disk without the window. Use the hole in the middle to align the two disks. Wait for it to dry.
Once dry, the disk with the window can be mounted over the joined disks and joined with either a split pin or chicago screws.
Make sure all disks are the same! The whole point of the game is that it's anonymous!
